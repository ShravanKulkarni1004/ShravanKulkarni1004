## ⚡ Projects

### 🔧 Automatic Solar Panel Tracking System (Prototype)
A collaborative mini-project developed with a team of three.  
- Used **Arduino**, **TCS3200 Color Sensor**, and **LDRs** to design an automatic solar panel alignment system.
- Learned hands-on circuit design, servo motor control, and real-time sensor integration.
- Guided by our mentor throughout the process — it was a great experience collaborating, sharing ideas, and solving practical challenges.

### 📘 Custom Compiler for an English-like Programming Language
- Built a compiler with **lexical analysis, parsing, and AST generation** using C++.
- Designed for a custom English-like language with a simplified syntax.
