- ⚡ Projects: As of now i have not build anything big, but as a team of three we were able to make an Automatic Solar Panel Tracking System(prototype). We were able to execute it with TCS3200 Color Sensor and Arduino. We also had to take help from our mentor who was guiding us throughout this mini project. It was overall a really good experience, conversing with like-minded people, sharing thoughts and coming up with some excellent ideas.
